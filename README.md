# Programming-for-Data-Analysis_2020_Practical-Assignment

This repository includes all files and details that make up the 2020 practical assignment for the module "programming for data analytics". This goal of the assignment was to develop an understanding of the numpy.random package in Python.

To gain this understanding many of the different functions within the package were researched. Code was developed and discussed to demonstrate an understanding of the key parts of the package. All workings were recorded in the jupyther notebook file "Assignment_2020_Programming for Data Analysis.ipynb" which can be found in this repository.

There were four distinct tasks completed as part of this assignment;

- Task 1 - Explain the overall purpose of the package.
- Task 2 - Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
- Task 3 - Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
- Task 4 - Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

This README provides a high level overview of the approach taken to complete the 4 aforementioned tasks.  For full details of the tasks refer to the jupyter notebook file; 'Assignment_2020_Programming for Data Analysis.ipynb' included in this repository.
